# Master Of Puppets

- The project current goal is to support `Burning Crusade Classic`

- Addon: https://github.com/FreeHongKongMMO/Happy-Pixels to read the game state. Over the time its been heavily rewritten and optimized.

- Frontend: ASP.NET Core Razor components

- BlazorServer: uses [ASP.NET Core Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor) to show the state in a browser.

- HeadlessServer: Run from CommandLine without UI. Requires valid configuration files present next to the executable.

- Backend: written in C#. Screen capture, mouse and keyboard clicking. No memory tampering and DLL injection.

- Further detail about the architecture can be found in [Blog post](http://www.codesin.net/post/wowbot/).

- Pathing: Indoors pathfinding only works properly if `PathFilename` is exists. For outdoor there are multiple solutions:
    * V1 Local - In processs [PPather](https://github.com/namreeb/PPather).
    * V1 Remote - Out of process [PPather](https://github.com/Xian55/WowClassicGrindBot/tree/main/PathingAPI).
    * V3 Remote - Out of process [AmeisenNavigation](https://github.com/Xian55/AmeisenNavigation/tree/feature/guess-z-coord-after-rewrite)

# Features

# Getting it working

## 1. Download this repository

Put the contents of the repo into a folder. e.g `C:\WowClassicGrindBot`. I am going to refer to this folder from now on, so just substitute your own folder path.

## 2.1 Using V1 Local/Remote Pathhing

Download the MPQ route files.
This files are required for to find paths from where you are to the grind area, vendor and repair.

* Classic: [**common-2.MPQ**](https://mega.nz/file/vXQCBCha#m7COhB9HQd86a5iNAT0-fMLsc-BtoTRO1eIBJNrdTH8) (1.7Gb)
* TBC: [**expansion.MPQ**](https://mega.nz/file/Of4i2YQS#egDGj-SXi9RigG-_8kPITihFsLom2L1IFF-ltnB3wmU) (1.8Gb)
* WOTLK: [**lichking.MPQ**](https://mega.nz/file/vDYWSTrK#fvaiuHpd-FTVsQT4ghGLK6QJLZyA87c1rlBEeu1_Btk) (2.5Gb)

Copy the previusly mentioned files to **\Json\MPQ** folder (e.g. `C:\WowClassicGrindBot\Json\MPQ`)

## 2.2 Using V3 Remote Pathing

Download the navmesh files.

* [**Classic + TBC**](https://mega.nz/file/7HgkHIyA#c_gzUeTadecWY0JDY3KT39ktfPGLs2vzt_90bMvhszk)

1. Extract and copy anywhere you want. like `C:\mmaps`
1. Create a build of [AmeisenNavigation](https://github.com/Xian55/AmeisenNavigation/tree/feature/guess-z-coord-after-rewrite)
1. Navigate to the build location and find `config.cfg`
1. Edit the file last line to look as `sMmapsPath=C:\mmaps`

# 3.1 System / Video Requirements

Resultions which based on either 4:3 aspect ratio, tested resolutions:
* 1024 x 768
* 1920 x 1080
* 3840 x 2160

For Nvidia users, under Nvidia Control panel settings
* Make sure the `Image Sharpening` under the `Manage 3D Settings`-> Global settings or Program Settings(for WoW) is set to `Sharpening Off, Scaling disabled`!

# 3.2 In-game Requirements

Required game client settings. Press `ESC` -> `System`
  * System > Advanced > Constrast: `50`
  * System > Advanced > Brightness: `50`
  * System > Advanced > Gamma from: `1.0`
  * System > Render Scale: `100%`
  * Disable Glow effect - type in the chat `/console ffxGlow 0`
  * To keep/save this settings make sure to properly shutdown the game.

## 3.3 Optional - Replace default game Font

Highly suggested to replace the default game font with a much **Bolder** one with [this guide](https://tbc.wowhead.com/guides/changing-wow-text-font)

Should be only concerned about `Friz Quadrata: the "Everything Else" Font` which is the `FRIZQT__.ttf` named file.

Example - [Robot-Medium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?thickness=5) - Shows big improvement to the `NpcNameFinder` compontent which is responsible to find - friendly, enemy, corpse - names above NPCs head.

## 4.1 Build Requirements

* Windows 7 and above
* [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
* **Note:** By default all builds will be **x86**.

## 4.2 Build the application

One of the following IDE or command line
* Visual Studio
* Visual Studio Code
* Powershell

e.g. Build from Powershell
```ps
cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

![Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/build.png)

## 5. Configuration process

The bot reads the game state using small blocks of colour shown at the top of the screen by an Addon. This needs to be configured.

1. Edit the batch script in `C:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer` called `run.bat`, change it to point at where you have put the repo BlazorServer folder

    e.g.
    ```ps
    start "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "http://localhost:5000"
    c:
    cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer
    dotnet run --configuration Release
    pause
    ```

2. Execute the `run.bat`. This will start the bot and Chrome, Wow must be already running. If you get `"Unable to find the Wow process is it running ?"` in the console window then it can't find exe.

3. When running the BlazorServer for the first time you will have to follow a setup process:
    * Just start the game and wait in the character selection screen.
    * Click `2. Addon Configuration`
    * Click `Find InstallPath` -> `InstallPath` should be filled otherwise, fill out manually
    * Fill the `Author` freely
    * Fill the `Title` freely
    * Then press `Install & Save` button -> Log should see `AddonConfigurator.Install successful`
    * Required to restart the Game 
    * Enter world with your desired character
    * Click `5. Frame Configuration`
    * [Guidance for good DataFrame](https://github.com/Xian55/WowClassicGrindBot/wiki/Guidance-for-good-DataFrame)
    * Click `Auto Configure and Restart`
    * [Validate FrameConfiguration](https://github.com/Xian55/WowClassicGrindBot/wiki/Validating-FrameConfiguration)

4. Under the `Addon Configuration` you can check if theres a **newer version available** for the addon. In that case just press the `install` button then have to restart the game client and the bot it self in order to use it properly. 

## 5. The bot should restart and show the dashboard page.

## 6. Configure the Wow Client - Interface Options

We need to make sure that certain interface options are set. The most important are Click to move and screen flashing on low health. See the list below.

### Interface Options

From the main menu (ESC) set the following under Interface Options:

| Interface Option | Value |
| ---- | ---- |
| Controls - Auto Loot | &#9745; |
| Controls - Interact on Left click | &#9744; |
| Combat - Do Not Flash Screen at Low Health | &#9745; |
| Combat - Auto Self Cast | &#9745; |
| Names - NPC Names | &#9745; |
| Names - Enemy Units (V) | &#9744; |
| Camera - Auto-Follow Speed | **Fast** |
| Camera - Camera Following Style | **Always** |
| Mouse - Click-to-Move | &#9745; |
| Mouse - Click-to-Move Camera Style | **Always** |

## 7. Configure the Wow Client - Key Bindings

From the main menu (ESC) -> `Key Bindings` set the following:

`Movement Keys`:

| In-Game | ClassConfiguration Name | Default ConsoleKey | Desciption |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Move Forward | ForwardKey | UpArrow | Change this to `87` for pressing `W` |
| Move Backward | BackwardKey | DownArrow | Change this to `83` for pressing `S` |
| Turn Left | TurnLeftKey | LeftArrow | Change this to `65` for pressing `A` |
| Turn Right | TurnRightKey | RightArrow | Change this to `68` for pressing `D` |
| Jump | JumpKey | Spacebar | ---- |
| Sit/Move down | StandUpKey | X |  Used after drinking or eatin |

To change the default movement keys to `WASD` in the ClassConfiguration file or look at the example `Json\class\Warrior_1_MovementKeys.json`
```json
"ForwardKey": 87,   // W
"BackwardKey": 83,  // S
"TurnLeftKey": 65,  // A
"TurnRightKey": 68, // D
```

`Targeting`:
| In-Game | Key | ClassConfiguration KeyAction Name | Desciption |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Target Nearest Enemy | Tab | TargetNearestTargetKey | ---- |
| Target Pet | Multiply | TargetPetKey | Only pet based class |
| Target Last Target | G | TargetLastTargetKey | ---- |
| Interact With Target | I | InteractKey | ---- |
| Assist Target | F | TargetTargetOfTargetKey | ---- |
| Pet attack | Subtract | PetAttackKey | Only pet based class |
| Target Focus | PageUp | TargetFocusKey | Only for `"AssistFocus"` Mode |

The `"Interact with Target"` keybind is super important as it allows the bot to turn towards and approach the target.
The `"Target Last Target"` keybind helps with looting.

## 7.1. Actionbar Key Bindings:

The default class profiles assumes the following `Keybinds` setup and using English Keyboard layout.
In total, `36` key supported.

Highly recommended to use the default setup, in order to get properly working the `ActionBarSlotCost` and `ActionBarSlotUsable`!

| ActionSlot | Key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-12 | 1,2,3 .. 9,0,-,= | 0 is the 10th key. |
| Bottom Right ActionBar | - | - |
| 49-58 | N1,N2,N3 .. N9,N0 | N means Numpad - 0 is the 10th key |
| Bottom Left ActionBar | - | - |
| 61-72 | F1,F2,F3 .. F11,F12 | F means Functions |

## 8. Configure the Wow Client - Bindpad addon

Bindpad allows keys to be easily bound to commands and macros. Type `/bindpad` to show it.

For each of the following click + to add a new key binding.

|  Key |  Command | Note |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Delete | /stopattack<br>/stopcasting<br>/petfollow | ---- |
| Insert | /cleartarget | ---- |
| PageDown | /follow | Only for `"AssistFocus"` Mode |

## 9. Class Configuration

Each class has a configuration file in `\Json\class` e.g. the config for a Rogue it is in file `C:\WowClassicGrindBot\Json\class\Rogue.json`.

The configuration file determines what spells you cast when pulling and in combat, where to vendor and repair and what buffs you give yourself.

Take a look at the class files in `/Json/class` for examples of what you can do. Your class file probably exists and just needs to be edited to set the pathing file name, but note they may be set up for level 60.

### KeyboardOnly

By Default, the bot attempts to use the mouse for the following reasons:
* (during `Follow Route`) Target selection
* (during `Consume Corpse`) `"Loot"`
* (during `Consume Corpse`) `"Skin"`

You can disable this behaviour by setting `KeyboardOnly` to `true`. Which has the following effects:
* `"Loot"` limited, only capable of looting by selecting last target. So after each combat only the **last npc** can be looted.
* `"Skin"` unavailable.
* Target selection limited to only `TargetNearestTargetKey`, which significantly reduce how quickly can find the next target.

### IntVariables

Gives the ability to the user to define global integer variables along the whole ClassConfiguration scope. 

For example look at the Warlock profiles.
```json
"IntVariables": {
    "DOT_MIN_HEALTH%": 35
}
```

### Path

The path that the class follows is a `json` file in `/Json/path/` which contains a list of `x` & `y` coordinates the bot will traverse while looking for mobs.
```json
"PathFilename": "58_Winterspring.2.json",   // the path to walk when alive
"PathThereAndBack": true,                   // if true walks the path and the walks it backwards.
"PathReduceSteps": true,                    // uses every other coordinate.
```
### **KeyAction** - Commands

Each `KeyAction` has its own properties to describe what the action is all about. 

Can specify conditions with `Requirement(s)` in order to create a matching action for the situation.

| Property Name | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Name of the command. For the `ActionBarPopulator`, lowercase means macro. | `""` |
| HasCastBar | Does the spell have a cast bar | `false` |
| StopBeforeCast | Should the char stop moving before casting the spell | `false` |
| Key | Key to press (`ConsoleKey`) | `""` |
| PressDuration | How many milliseconds to press the key | `50` |
| Form | Shapeshift/Stance form to be in to cast this spell | `Form.None` |
| Charge | How many times shoud this Command be used in sequence and ignore its Cooldown | `1` |
| Cooldown | **Note this is not the in-game cooldown!**<br>The time in milliseconds until the command can be used again.<br>This property will be updated when the backend registers the `Key` keypress. It has no feedback from the game. | `0` |
| School | Indicate what type of element. `SchoolMask.`<br>(`Physical, Holy, Fire, Nature, Frost, Shadow, Arcane`) | `SchoolMask.None` |
| MinMana | The minimum `Mana` required to cast the spell | `0` |
| MinRage | The minimum `Rage` required to cast the spell | `0` |
| MinEnergy | The minimum `Energy` required to cast the spell | `0` |
| MinComboPoints | The minimum combo points required to cast the spell | `0` |
| WhenUsable | When not in in-game cooldown(`GCD` included) and have the min resource(mana,rage,energy) to use it. | `false` |
| Requirement | Single [Requirement](#Requirement) | `false` |
| Requirements | List of [Requirement](#Requirement) | `false` |
| WaitForWithinMeleeRange | `PullGoal` only - After casting wait for the mob to be in melee range. Will be repeated until the conditions are met | `false` |
| WaitForGCD | Indicates should wait for the GCD | `true` |
| SkipValidation | After button press, skip awaiting in-game effect | `false` |
| ResetOnNewTarget | Reset the cooldown if the target changes | `false` |
| Log | Write to the log when this key is evaluated | `true` |
| DelayBeforeCast | A delay in milliseconds before this spell is cast | `0` |
| DelayAfterCast | The delay in milliseconds after the spell is cast | `1450` |
| AfterCastWaitBuff | After the cast happened, should wait until __(player debuff/buff or target debuff/buff)__ changed | `false` |
| AfterCastWaitNextSwing | After the cast wait for the next melee swing to land | `false` | 
| Cost | For Adhoc goals the priority | `18` |
| InCombat | Should combat matter when attempt to cast?<br>Accepted values: `"any value for doesn't matter"` or `"true"` or `"false"` | `false` |
| StepBackAfterCast | Hero will go back for X milliseconds after casting this spell, usable for spells like `Frost Nova` | `0` |
| PathFilename | Only `"NPC"` goals, this is a short path to get close to the NPC to avoid walls etc. | `""` |
| UseWhenTargetIsCasting | Checks for the target casting/channeling any spell (possible values: `null` -> ignore / `false` -> when enemy not casting / `true` -> when enemy casting) | `null` |

Some of these properties are optional and not required to be specified. However can create pretty complex conditions and branches to suit the situation.

e.g. - bare minimum for a spell which has castbar. **Note:** _there are some spells which dosen't have visible castbar. like `"Throw"`, `"Shoot"`, `"Auto Shot"`_
```json
{
    "Name": "Frostbolt",
    "Key": "1",
    "HasCastBar": true,   //<-- Must be indicated the spell has a castbar
}
```

e.g. - bare minimum for a spell which is instant (no castbar)
```json
{
    "Name": "Earth Shock",
    "Key": "6"
}
```

Theres are only two specially named KeyAction `Food` and `Water` which is reserved for eating and drinking.

They already have some prebaked `Requirement` conditions in order to avoid mistype the definition. 

The bare minimum for `Food` and `Water` is looks something like this.
```json
{
    "Name": "Food",
    "Key": "-",
    "Requirement": "Health% < 50"
},
{
    "Name": "Water",
    "Key": "=",
    "Requirement": "Mana% < 50"
}
```

e.g. for Rogue ability
```json
{
    "Name": "Slice And Dice",
    "Key": "3",
    "MinEnergy": 25,
    "MinComboPoints": 2,
    "Cooldown": 3000,
    "Requirement": "!Slice And Dice"
}
```

---
### Pull Goal

This is the `Sequence` of `KeyAction(s)` that are used when pulling a mob.

e.g.
```json
"Pull": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Concussive Shot",
            "Key": "9",
            "StopBeforeCast": true,
            "Requirements": ["HasRangedWeapon", "!InMeleeRange", "HasAmmo"]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Combat Goal

The `Sequence` of `KeyAction(s)` that are used when in combat and trying to kill a mob. 

The combat goal does the first available command on the list. 

The goal then runs again re-evaluating the list before choosing the first available command again, and so on until the mob is dead.

e.g.
```json
"Combat": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Fireball",
            "Key": "2",
            "HasCastBar": true,
            "MinMana": 30,
            "Requirement": "TargetHealth% > 20"
        },
        {
            "Name": "AutoAttack",
            "Requirement": "!AutoAttacking"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Approach",
            "Log": false
        }
    ]
}
```

### Adhoc Goals

These `Sequence` of `KeyAction(s)` are done when not in combat and are not on cooldown. Suitable for personal buffs.

e.g.
```json
"Adhoc": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Frost Armor",
            "Key": "3",
            "MinMana": 60,
            "Requirement": "!Frost Armor"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Food",
            "Key": "=",
            "Requirement": "Health% < 30"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Water",
            "Key": "-",
            "Requirement": "Mana% < 30"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Parallel Goals

These `Sequence` of `KeyAction(s)` are done when not in combat and are not on cooldown. 

The keypresses happens simultaneously on all `KeyAction(s)` which mets the `Requirement`.

Suitable for `Food` and `Water`.

e.g.
```json
"Parallel": {
    "Sequence": [
        {
            "Name": "Food",
            "Key": "=",
            "Requirement": "Health% < 50"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Water",
            "Key": "-",
            "Requirement": "Mana% < 50"
        }
    ]
}
```
### NPC Goals

These command are for vendoring and repair.

e.g.
```json
"NPC": {
    "Sequence": [
    {
        "Name": "Repair",
        "Key": "C",
        "Requirement": "Items Broken",
        "PathFilename": "Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json",
        "Cost": 6
    },
    {
        "Name": "Sell",
        "Key": "C",
        "Requirement": "BagFull",
        "PathFilename": "Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json",
        "Cost": 6
    }
    ]
}
```

The "Key" is a key that is bound to a macro. The macro needs to target the NPC, and if necessary open up the repair or vendor page. The bot will click the key and the npc will be targetted. Then it will click the interact button which will cause the bot to move to the NPC and open the NPC options, this may be enough to get the auto repair and auto sell greys to happen. But the bot will click the button again in case there are further steps (e.g. SelectGossipOption), or you have many greys or items to sell.

e.g. Sell macro - bound to the `"C"` key using BindPad or Key bindings
```cs
/tar Jannos Ironwill
/run DataToColor:sell({"Light Leather","Cheese","Light Feather"});
```

e.g. Repair macro
```cs
/tar Vargus
/script SelectGossipOption(1)
```

e.g. Delete various items
```cs
/run for b=0,4 do for s=1,GetContainerNumSlots(b) do local n=GetContainerItemLink(b,s) if n and (strfind(n,"Slimy") or strfind(n,"Red Wolf") or strfind(n,"Mystery") or strfind(n,"Spider L")) then PickupContainerItem(b,s) DeleteCursorItem() end end end
```

Because some NPCs are hard to reach, there is the option to add a short path to them e.g. `"Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json"`. The idea is that the start of the path is easy to get to and is a short distance from the NPC, you record a path from the easy to reach spot to the NPC with a distance between spots of 1. When the bot needs to vend or repair it will path to the first spot in the list, then walk closely through the rest of the spots, once they are walked it will press the defined Key, then walk back through the path.

e.g. `Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json` in the `Json/path` folder looks like this:
```json
[{"X":51.477,"Y":29.347},{"X":51.486,"Y":29.308},{"X":51.495,"Y":29.266},{"X":51.503,"Y":29.23},{"X":51.513,"Y":29.186},{"X":51.522,"Y":29.147},{"X":51.531,"Y":29.104},{"X":51.54,"Y":29.063},{"X":51.551,"Y":29.017},{"X":51.559,"Y":28.974},{"X":51.568,"Y":28.93},{"X":51.578,"Y":28.889},{"X":51.587,"Y":28.853},{"X":51.597,"Y":28.808}]
```
If you have an NPC that is easy to get to such as the repair NPC in Arathi Highlands then the path only needs to have one spot in it. e.g.
```json
[{"X":45.8,"Y":46.6}]
```

### Repeatable Quests Handin

In theory if there is a repeatable quest to collect items, you could set up a NPC task as follows. See 'Bag requirements' for Requirements format.
```json
{
    "Name": "Handin",
    "Key": "K",
    "Requirements": ["BagItem:12622:5","BagItem:12623:5"],
    "PathFilename": "Path_to_NPC.json",
    "Cost": 6
}
```

# Requirement

A requirement is something that must be evaluated to be `true` for the `KeyAction` to run. 

Not all `KeyAction` needs a requirement, some just rely on a `Cooldown` or `MinMana`/`MinRage`/`MinEnergy`. 

A requirement can be put into a list if there is more than one.

e.g.
```json
{
    "Name": "Soul Shard",
    "Key": "9",
    "HasCastBar": true,
    "Requirements": ["TargetHealth% < 36", "not BagItem:6265:3"],     //<--- Requirement List
    "MinMana": 55
},
{
    "Name": "Curse of Weakness",
    "Key": "6",
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "ResetOnNewTarget": true,
    "Requirement": "!Curse of Weakness",                           //<--- Single Requirement
    "MinMana": 20
}
```

### **Negate a requirement**

Every requirement can be negated by adding one of the `Negate keyword` in front of the requirement.

Formula: `[Negate keyword][requirement]`

| Negate keyword |
| --- |
| `"not "` |
| `"!"` |

e.g.
```json
"Requirement": "not Curse of Weakness"
"Requirement": "!BagItem:6265:3"
```
---

### **And / Or multiple Requirements**

Two or more Requirement can be merged into a single Requirement object. 

By default every Requirement is concataneted with `[and]` operator which means in order to execute the `KeyAction`, every member in the `RequirementsObject` must be evaluated to `true`. However this consctruct allows to concatanete with `[or]`. Nesting parenthesis are also supported.

Formula: `[Requirement1] [Operator] [RequirementN]`

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| "&&" | And |
| "\|\|" | Or |

e.g.
```json
"Requirements": ["Has Pet", "TargetHealth% < 70 || TargetCastingSpell"]
"Requirement": "!Form:Druid_Bear && Health% < 50 || MobCount > 2",
"Requirement": "(Judgement of the Crusader && CD_Judgement <= 1500 && TargetHealth% > 20) || TargetCastingSpell"
```
---
### **Value base requirements**

Value base requirement is the most basic way to create a condition. 

Formula: `[Keyword] [Operator] [Numeric integer value]`

**Note:** `[Numeric integer value]` always the _right-hand_ side expression value

| Operator | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `==` | Equals |
| `<=` | Less then or Equals |
| `>=` | Greater then or Equals |
| `<` | Less then |
| `>` | Greater then |

| Keyword | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Health%` | Player health in percentage |
| `TargetHealth%` | Target health in percentage |
| `PetHealth%` | Pet health in percentage |
| `Mana%` | Player mana in percentage |
| `Mana` | Player current mana |
| `Rage` | Player current rage |
| `Energy` | Player current energy |
| `Combo Point` | Player current combo points on the target |
| `BagCount` | How many items in the player inventory |
| `MobCount` | How many detected, alive, and currently fighting mob around the player |
| `MinRange` | Minimum distance(yard) between the player and the target  |
| `MaxRange` | Maximum distance(yard) between the player and the target |
| `LastAutoShotMs` | Time since last detected AutoShot happened in milliseconds |
| `LastMainHandMs` | Time since last detected Main Hand Melee swing happened in milliseconds |
| `MainHandSpeed` | Returns the player Main hand attack speed in milliseconds |
| `MainHandSwing` | Returns the player predicted next main hand swing time |
| `CD` | Returns the context KeyAction **in-game** cooldown in milliseconds |
| `CD_{KeyAction.Name}` | Returns the given `{KeyAction.Name}` **in-game** cooldown in milliseconds |
| `Cost_{KeyAction.Name}` | Returns the given `{KeyAction.Name}` cost value |

For the `MinRange` and `MaxRange` gives an approximation range distance between the player and target.

**Note:** _Every class has it own unique way to find these values by using different in game items/spells/interact ways._

| MinRange | MaxRange | alias Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 5 | "InMeleeRange" |
| 5 | 15 | "IsInDeadZoneRange" |

Its worth mention that `CD_{KeyAction.Name}` is a dynamic binding.<br>Each `KeyAction` has its own in-game Cooldown which is not the same as `KeyAction.Cooldown`!

e.g. Single Requirement
```json
"Requirement": "Health%>70"
"Requirement": "TargetHealth%<=10"
"Requirement": "PetHealth% < 10"
"Requirement": "Mana% <= 40"
"Requirement": "Mana < 420"
"Requirement": "Energy >= 40"
"Requirement": "Rage > 90"
"Requirement": "BagCount > 80"
"Requirement": "MobCount > 1"
"Requirement": "MinRange < 5"
"Requirement": "MinRange > 15"
"Requirement": "MaxRange > 20"
"Requirement": "MaxRange > 35"
"Requirement": "LastAutoShotMs <= 500"
"Requirement": "LastMainHandMs <= 500"
"Requirement": "CD_Judgement < 1500"                 // The remaining cooldown on Judgement is less then GCD(1500)
"Requirement": "CD_Hammer of Justice > CD_Judgement" // The remaining cooldown on Hammer of Justice is greater then 8 seconds
"Requirement": "Rage >= Cost_Heroic Strike"          // Create a condition like if player current rage is greater then or equal the cost of Heroic Strike
"Requirement": "MainHandSpeed > 3500"   // Main hand attack speed is greater then 3.5 seconds
"Requirement": "MainHandSwing > -400"   // 400 milliseconds before next predicted main swing happen
"Requirement": "MainHandSwing > -400"   // 400 milliseconds before next predicted main swing happen
```

e.g. List of Requirements
```json
"Requirements": [
    "TargetHealth% > DOT_MIN_HEALTH%",  // where DOT_MIN_HEALTH% is a user defined variable
    "!Immolate"
],
```

e.g. for `CD`: It's a good idea to put `CD` in healing spells to take consideration of the spell interruption.
```json
{
    "Name": "Flash of Light",
    "Key": "6",
    "HasCastBar": true,
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "Requirements": ["Health% < 60", "TargetHealth% > 20", "CD==0", "MobCount < 2", "LastMainHandMs <= 1000"],
    "Cooldown": 6000
},
```

e.g. for `CD_{KeyAction.Name}`: Where `Hammer of Justice` referencing the `Judgement` **in-game** Cooldown to do an awesome combo!
```json
{
    "Name": "Judgement",
    "Key": "1",
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "Requirements": ["Seal of the Crusader", "!Judgement of the Crusader"],
    "DelayAfterCast": 0
},
{
    "Name": "Hammer of Justice",
    "Key": "7",
    "WhenUsable": true,
    "Requirements": ["Judgement of the Crusader && CD_Judgement <= 1500 && TargetHealth% > 20 || TargetCastingSpell"]
}
```

### **npcID requirements**

If a particular npc is required then this requirement can be used.

Formula: `npcID:[Numeric integer value]`

```

---
### **Spell requirements**

If a given Spell `name` or `id` must be known by the player then you can use this requirement. 

Useful to determine when the given `Spell` is exists in the spellbook.

It has the following formulas:

* `Spell:[name]`. The `name` only works with the English client name.
* `Spell:[id]`

e.g.

* `"Requirement": "Spell:687"` - Must have know [`id=687`](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=687)
* `"Requirement": "Spell:Demon Skin"` - Must have known the given `name`

"Requirement": "not Talent:Suppression"        // Must have not know the given `name` 
```
---
### **Trigger requirements**

If you feel the current Requirement toolset is not enough for you, you can use other addons such as **WeakAura's** Trigger to control a given bit.

1. **The regarding in-game Addon API is looks like this**

    ```lua
    YOUR_CHOOSEN_ADDON_NAME_FROM_ADDON_CONFIG:Set(bit, value)
    -- bit: 0-23
    -- value: 0 or 1 or true or false

    --e.g. by using default addon name
    DataToColor:Set(0,1)
    DataToColor:Set(0,0)
    DataToColor:Set(23,true)
    DataToColor:Set(23,false)
    ```

    e.g. you can make your awesome WeakAura. Then you can put the following Addon API in the

    WeakAura -> Actions -> On Show -> Custom
    ```lua
    DataToColor:Set(0,1) -- enable Trigger 0
    ```

    WeakAura -> Actions -> On Hide -> Custom
    ```lua
    DataToColor:Set(0,0)  -- disable Trigger 0
    ```

    Example Weakaura for hunter pet in 10y range for feed pet
    ```lua
    !WA:2!1rvWUTTrq0O6dPGOiXXT1afTaLWT1ibTiW2fnfOO9GOmvScKTuiPJtApqUK7qXnMC3f7Uu2khf6HCwFc6CpXpH8fqi0Va)j4VGUlPQHBrIoioZUZS78EZ82o93Qyl8w43(DcwPkNqbXOtdgo4exXLJstLGQtfMi55OzbWLQpALmdHzx8Q29(Q7uHOjzmXygHQI75EsGRh3(wjeMYefivipurkG1ED4BMukvScteNYXif4btbQ6kuPEvKIKCgbRYC6QDfOefHrLpXtQqc1UlWSW2SJIB)Y)SdrkuaRhlNj(fFq9W9(H9FKdHsuBxF)S4uTLmB367hvV57l29E0CLGmzciK3BxXAZ3(1ZjkO4eub05kzzCt9nwaPKl98h7oC41LsiSaKs0eiyghIENzH)nNi(dmUtanHss8ZyxmIgT6)4ELS5tpglxZO05M4l11CKJ5)d4GYtGOtGD2FVQMJMovxHqwtGzikoAHKd55nLOJsxc12x1KriJdcKM625x)TLyiUmn1uHIJChoU)Pdx0Gftc8pF8WUVY1l0Z9PUNeE4a)UodDpCL5gsB59bhgDd891he5YQWED9dc9d66f0e5nhxuScLRTTCm9zRARkpt5y3ldsoVHEIHm0uctKTsaOC)Bk)MZ5g0enVXCawATWSrdOIQUfHN5r1XTEBLEe58OQB1l4B27OUbHh7)0WZoAGUD5TOKUUXAXFGbztHGw)Jzy4VUd)lFVdTTgEMzx816rCqqr5Vq3g0mZFSqc5PTt(oJccgDSg2ufFZ(cYBSFEjcR7bi7GGLA(ZdMygITCYzi8lAk7KCKugvV32EfL5kILJg0jBxpWYRzNDJLe6KCi(OtnQk96osYBataZn3JV25lwlhFzRCCJLIMRXqboknqwMWOysJ8XI)nFyzjxajedM2yLwbQ1ZJ4TjjMT(raXR1sns6m94r)GLkwY0ws4JhV9oem)BZknKJTEO1MqT3FVz2nnnB99yNca2SZbLeCL354H)0lF4Zrf)EvQq3e9vgAAJRBFiPVzjt9h73ZZ19eVeJq9zBO)fRbtkzI18lyc8zceF(zRn4F)hgA4z6jfssOktaAbxoEwvlN18cWZ60PZgl1d1aU5fN)8tQi02dqdoRfikP18j13RF9UougfEhGKMQgOtuz3DfUu0erOrbO1Ngkxo3eJbg1eNceHQZTMu)67wFEDEDH28t))RSL07hF8p)4d2A6F)Y)5
    ```

1. **Then outside of the game, you can specify the following in the ClassConfiguration file ex. `class/Hunter_62.json`**

    Formula: `Trigger:[bit]:[name]`

    Where the `bit` is 0-23 and the `name` is a free text which shows up in the frontend.

    e.g.
    ```json
    "Requirement": "Trigger:0:Pet in range"           // Trigger 0 must be true
    "Requirement": "Trigger:23:My Awesome trigger"    // Trigger 23 must be true
    "Requirement": "not Trigger:6:Suppression"        // Trigger 6 must be false
    ```

### **SpellInRange requirements**

Allow requirements about spell range to be used, the spell in question depends upon the class being played.

`"SpellInRange:0"` or `"not SpellInRange:0"` for a Warrior is Charge and for a Mage is Fireball. 

This might be useful if you were close enough for a Fireball, but not for a Frostbolt.

Formula: `SpellInRange:[Numeric integer value]`

| Class | Spell | id |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rogue | Sinister Strike | 0 |
| Rogue | Throw | 1 |
| Rogue | Shoot Gun | 2 |
| Druid | Wrath | 0 |
| Druid | Bash | 1 |
| Druid | Rip | 2 |
| Druid | Maul | 3 |
| Warrior | Charge | 0 |
| Warrior | Rend | 1 |

| Shaman | Earth Shock | 1 |

e.g.
```json
"Requirement": "SpellInRange:4"
"Requirements": ["Health% < 80", "SpellInRange:2"]
```

---
### **Target Casting Spell requirement**

Combined with the `KeyAction.UseWhenTargetIsCasting` property, this requirement can limit on which enemy target spell your character will react or ignore.

Firstly `"TargetCastingSpell"` as it is without mentioning any spellID. Simply tells if the target is doing any cast at all.

Secondly can specify the following Format `"TargetCastingSpell:spellID1|spellID2|..."` which translates to "if Target is casting spellID1 OR spellID2 OR ...".

e.g. Rogue_20.json
```json
{
    "Name": "Kick",
    "UseWhenTargetIsCasting": true
},
{
    "Name": "Kick",
    "Requirement": "not TargetCastingSpell"
},
{

# Modes

The default mode for the bot is to grind, but there are other modes. The mode is set in the root of the class file.

e.g. Rogue.json
```json
{
    "PathFilename": "Herb_EPL.json",
    "Mode": "AttendedGather",
    "GatherFindKeys":  ["1","2"]
}
```

The available modes are:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"Grind"` | Default mode.<br>Follows the route. Attempts to find Non-Blacklist targets to kill.<br>(*if enabled*) Attempts to `"Loot"` and `"Skin"` nearby corpses.<br>(*if exists*) Executes `"Adhoc"`, `"NPC"`, `"Parallel"`, `"Pull"`, `"Combat"` Sequences |
| `"AttendedGrind"` | Similair to `"Grind"`.<br>Navigation disabled.<br>The only difference is that **you** control the route, and select what target to kill. |
| `"CorpseRun"` | Runs back to the corpse after dies.<br>Can be useful if you are farming an instance and die, the bot will run you back some or all of the way to the instance entrance. |
| `"AttendedGather"` | Have to `Start Bot` under `Gather` tab and stay at `Gather` tab.<br>Follows the route and scan the minimap for the yellow nodes which indicate a herb or mining node.<br>Once one or more present, the navigation stops and alerts you by playing beeping sound!<br>**You** have to click at the herb/mine. In the `LogComponent` the necessary prompt going be shown to proceed.<br>**Important note**: `Falling` and `Jumping` means the same thing, if you lose the ground the bot going to take over the control! Be patient.<br>(*if exists*) Executes `"Adhoc"`, `"NPC"`, `"Parallel"`, `"Pull"`, `"Combat"` Sequences |
| `"AssistFocus"` | Navigation disabled.<br>Requires a friendly `focus` to exists. Follows the `focus` target.<br>Once a hostile `focustarget` in-combat exists, attempts to assist it (kill it).<br>After leaving combat, (*if enabled*) attempts to Loot and Skin nearby corpses.<br>Works inside Instances.<br>(*if exists*) Executes `"Adhoc"`, `"Parallel"`, `"Pull"`, `"Combat"` Sequences. |

# User Interface

## Other devices

The user interface is shown in a browser on port **5000** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). This allows you to view it from another device on your lan.

To access you PC port **5000** from another device, you will need to open up port **5000** in your firewall.

Control Panel\System and Security\Windows Defender Firewall - Advanced Settings

* Inbound Rules
* New Rule
* Port
* TCP
* Specific local ports: **5000**
* Allow the Connection
* Private, Public, Domain (You may get away with just Private)
* Name "Wow bot"

## Components

The UI has the following components:

### Screenshot

![Screenshot Component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/screenshotComponent.png)

### Player Summary

Show the player state. A hyper link to wowhead appears for the mob you are fighting so you can check out what it drops.

![Player Summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/PlayerSummary.png)

### Route

This component shows:

* The main path
* Your location
* The location of any deaths
* Pathed routes

![Route](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/Route.png)

Pathed routes are shown in Green.

### Goals

This component contains a button to allow the bot to be enabled and disabled.

This displays the finite state machine. The state is goal which can run and has the highest priority. What determines if the goal can run are its pre-conditions such as having a target or being in combat. The executing goal is allowed to complete before the next goal is determined.

Some goals (combat,pull target) contain a list of spells which can be cast. The combat task evaluates its spells in order with the first available being cast. The goal then gives up control so that a higher priority task can take over (e.g. Healing potion).

The visualisation of the pre-conditions and spell requirements makes it easier to understand what the bot is doing and determine if the class file needs to be tweaked.

# Recording a Path

Various path are needed by the bot:

The path to run when grinding (PathFilename in root of class files).
```json
"PathFilename": "16_LochModan.json",
"PathThereAndBack": true,
"PathReduceSteps": false,
```

The short path to get to the vendor/repairer when there are obstacles close to them (PathFilename withing NPC task):
```json
{
    "Name": "Sell",
    "Key": "C",
    "Requirement": "BagFull",
    "PathFilename": "Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json",
    "Cost": 6
}
```

## Recording a new path

To record a new path place your character where the start of the path should be, then click on the 'Record Path' option on the left hand side of the bot's browser window. Then click 'Record New'.

![New Path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/Path_New.png)

Now walk the path the bot should take.

If you make a mistake you can remove spots by clicking on them on the list on the right. Then either enter new values for the spot or click 'Remove'.

For tricky parts you may want to record spots close together by using the 'Distance between spots' slider (Smaller number equals closer together).

Once the path is complete click 'Save'. This path will be saved with a generic filename e.g. `Path_20201108112650.json`, you will need to go into your `/Json/path` and rename it to something sensible.

![Recording Path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/Path_Recording.png)

## Types of paths

### There and back 

```json
"PathThereAndBack": true
```

These paths are run from one end to the other and then walked backwards back to the start. So the end does not need to be near the start.

![There and back path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/Path_Thereandback.png)

### Joined up

```json
"PathThereAndBack": false
```

These paths are run from one end to the other and then repeated. So the path needs to join up with itself i.e. the end needs to be near the start.

![Circular path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/Path_Circular.png)

## Tips  

Try to avoid the path getting too close to:

* Obstactles like trees, houses.
* Steep hills or cliffs (falling off one can make the bot get stuck).
* Camps/groups of mobs.
* Elite mob areas, or solo elite paths.

The best places to grind are:

* Places with non casters i.e. beasts. So that they come to you when agro'd.
* Places where mobs are far apart (so you don't get adds).
* Places with few obstacles.
* Flat ground.


# Pathing

Pathing is built into the bot so you don't need to do anything special except download the MPQ files. You can though run it on its own server to visualise routes as they are created by the bot, or to play with route finding.

The bot will try to calculate a path in the following situations:

* Travelling to a vendor or repair.
* Doing a corpse run.
* Resuming the grind path at startup, after killing a mob, or if the distance to the next stop in the path is not a short distance.

## Video:

[![Pathing Video Youtube](images/PathingApi.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz_jFZfxSdc&t=254s&ab_channel=JulianPerrott)

## Running on its own server.

In visual studio just set PathingAPI as the startup project or from the command line:

```ps
cd C:\WowClassicGrindBot\PathingAPI
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

Then in a browser go to http://localhost:5001

There are 3 pages:

* Watch API Calls
* Search
* Swagger

Requests to the API can be done in a new browser tab like this or via the Swagger tab. You can then view the result in the Watch API calls viewer.

```
http://localhost:5001/api/PPather/MapRoute?map1=1446&x1=51.0&y1=29.3&map2=1446&x2=38.7&y2=20.1
```

Search gives some predefined locations to search from and to.

## Running it along side the bot

In visual studio right click the solution and set Multiple startup projects to BlazorServer and PathingApi and run.

Or from 2 command lines `dotnet run` each.

```ps
cd c:\WowClassicGrindBot\PathingAPI
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

```ps
cd c:\WowClassicGrindBot\BlazorServer
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## As a library used within the bot

The bot will use the PathingAPI to work out routes, these are shown on the route map as green points.
